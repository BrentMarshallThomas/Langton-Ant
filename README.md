# Langton-Ant

# Description: This program makes a virtual Langton's Ant simulation based on input parameters of a square board size,
#              ant starting location, ant starting orientation, and the number of steps. Then prints out the resulting
#              game board with black("#") and white ("_") spaces and current ant location ("8").
